### Hi there 👋 Glad you are here, for any reasons 🙈
- I'm Viet Hoang, a second-year student. But you can call me Banh bao. "Banh bao" is a kind of Vietnamese dumplings made with minced pork.
- I'm currently learning Computer Science at Ha Noi University of Industry ✏️
- I'm interested in games, especially League of Legends and Valorant 🎮
- I'm being lazy every so often, but not like a couch potato 😉
